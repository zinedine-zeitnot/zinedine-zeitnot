# Hiya 👋 and, welcome to my programming playground! :carousel_horse:

I'm Emeric. Pythonista at heart, serverless aficionado & data scientist by profession. So there, you'll mostly find data-related experiments with Python and AWS.

♟️ Chess player yourself? 👉 Meet me on [Lichess](https://lichess.org) @zinedine_zeitnot (so you now know it all about my pen name) and let's have some interesting game together.
